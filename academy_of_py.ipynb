    "There are a few easily noticeable trends using the data. Firstly, charter schools have significantly higher passing rates versus district schools. Secondly, students from large schools are quite less likely to pass than those from small or medium-sized schools. Finally, and most surprisingly, it seems that the less money spent on a student, the more likely they are to succeed. One would expect the opposite relationship."
